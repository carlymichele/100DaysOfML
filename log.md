# 100 Days Of ML Code - Challenge Log


### Day 0: October 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Attended SciKit Learn Bootcamp

**Time**: 5 hours

**Thoughts:** After this bootcamp, I finally understand how to use linear regression models in SkLearn. Understanding the math helped me figure out what my code was doing, but the hands on practice gave me the extra confidence to start building my own ML models.

### Day 1: October 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Attended Google Developer Group DevFest 2018

**Time**: 8 hours

**Thoughts:** I attended several talks on ML including:
    * Creating an Action on Google Assistant
    * Building a Twitter Image Bot with Flickr
    * Google Assistant CodeLab Demo

I also networked with many engineers and students. I loved meeting people who are passionate about their craft. I left the event feeling very motivated and excited to continue studying.
