# 100 Days Of ML Code - Challenge Log

## Day 1: October 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Deep Learning with Apple's Turi Create

**Time**: 3 hours

**Thoughts:** Today I attended a tech talk on Intro to Deep Learning and how to use Turi Create to build ML models in an app. Honestly, most of the information went over my head but I learned more about how companies use ML to make photo filters or make prediction models for stock prices. I also networked with other developers. Definitely worth my time.


## Day 2: October 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: ML Study Group #1

**Time**: 2 hours

**Thoughts:** I recently joined a study group for the Coursera Machine Learning class with Andrew Ng. So far, we have reviewed the same intro topics that I already know about: cost function, how gradient descent works, etc. I am looking forward to learning how to apply my knowledge of Linear Algebra to my own case studies.


## Day 3: October 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Intro to Google CodeLabs

**Time**: 2 hours

**Thoughts:** Learned how to create and deploy my first Action on Google using Google CodeLabs and Firebase. I have never used Google Assistant before but this would be a fun and easy way to make conversational applications.


## Day 4: October 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: ML Study Group #2

**Time**: 1.5 hours

**Thoughts:** This week, my study group went over Linear Algebra for ML. I am already taking this class in school, but the review helped me connect my classwork with our code examples.


### Day 5: October 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Attended SciKit Learn Bootcamp

**Time**: 5 hours

**Thoughts:** After this bootcamp, I finally understand how to use linear regression models in SkLearn. Understanding the math helped me figure out what my code was doing, but the hands on practice gave me the extra confidence to start building my own ML models.


### Day 6: October 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Attended Google Developer Group DevFest 2018

**Time**: 8 hours

**Thoughts:** I attended several talks on ML including:
* Creating an Action on Google Assistant
* Building a Twitter Image Bot with Flickr
* Google Assistant CodeLab Demo

I also networked with many engineers and students. I loved meeting people who are passionate about their craft. I left the event feeling very motivated and excited to continue studying.


### Day 7: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Linear Regression Demo Notebook

**Time**: 2 hours

**Thoughts:** I added to and fixed errors in the model that I started last Saturday. It feels good to finally have something completed in my repertoire.
