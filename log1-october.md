# 100 Days Of ML Code - Month 1 (October 17 - October 31)
 #100DaysofMLCode Challenge: to commit an hour a day (or almost everyday) to code/study machine learning for 100 days.

## Day 1: October 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Deep Learning with Apple's Turi Create

**Time**: 3 hours

**Thoughts:** Today I attended a tech talk on Intro to Deep Learning and how to use Turi Create to build ML models in an app. Honestly, most of the information went over my head but I learned more about how companies use ML to make photo filters or make prediction models for stock prices. I also networked with other developers. Definitely worth my time.

## Day 2: October 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CourseraML: Reviewing Intro to ML videos

**Time**: 2 hours

**Thoughts:** I spent some time listening to the introduction videos for the Coursera Machine Learning class with Andrew Ng. I already knew most of the information from watching intro videos on Youtube, but some of the examples he used were new to me.


## Day 3: October 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: ML Study Group #1

**Time**: 2 hours

**Thoughts:** I recently joined a study group for t. So far, we have reviewed the same intro topics that I already know about: cost function, how gradient descent works, etc. I am looking forward to learning how to apply my knowledge of Linear Algebra to my own case studies.


## Day 4: October 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Intro to Google CodeLabs

**Time**: 2 hours

**Thoughts:** Learned how to create and deploy my first Action on Google using Google CodeLabs and Firebase. I have never used Google Assistant before but this would be a fun and easy way to make conversational applications.


## Day 5: October 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: ML Study Group #2

**Time**: 1.5 hours

**Thoughts:** This week, my study group went over Linear Algebra for ML. I am already taking this class in school, but the review helped me connect my classwork with our code examples.


### Day 6: October 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Attended SciKit Learn Bootcamp

**Time**: 5 hours

**Thoughts:** After this bootcamp, I finally understand how to use linear regression models in SkLearn. Understanding the math helped me figure out what my code was doing, but the hands on practice gave me the extra confidence to start building my own ML models.


### Day 7: October 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Attended Google Developer Group DevFest 2018

**Time**: 8 hours

**Thoughts:** I attended several talks on ML including:
* Creating an Action on Google Assistant
* Building a Twitter Image Bot with Flickr
* Google Assistant CodeLab Demo

I also networked with many engineers and students. I loved meeting people who are passionate about their craft. I left the event feeling very motivated and excited to continue studying.

### Day 8: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Linear Regression Demo Notebook

**Time**: 2 hours

**Thoughts:** I added to and fixed errors in the model that I started last Saturday at the Metis Bootcamp in SF. It feels good to finally have something completed in my repertoire.

### Day 9: October 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Creating my Kaggle Account

**Time**: 1 hour

**Thoughts:** Today I created an account on Kaggle and completed one of the Intro Notebooks. I'm still not completely sure how to use Kaggle and need more time to click around the website.


### Day 10: October 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Personal Development Videos for ML Developers

**Time**: 1 hour

**Thoughts:** I put in a very small amount of effort today but something is better than nothing. I started following a couple of machine learning podcasts so that I have something other than music to listen to when I'm in transit. Today, I watched a few ml videos on how to get jobs as a Data Scientist. I want to research opportunities to combine AI/ML and community service projects.
