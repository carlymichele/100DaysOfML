# 100 Days Of ML Code - Month 2 (November 2 - Present)
 #100DaysofMLCode Challenge: to commit an hour a day (or almost everyday) to code/study machine learning for 100 days.

### Day 11: November 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CourseraML: HW #2 - Linear Regression

**Time**: 1 hour

**Thoughts:** Completing the first MATLAB assignment in my Coursera class. I will probably use Jupyter Notebooks for uploading my assignments to GitHub as it is easier to use and better for graphing.
