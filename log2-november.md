# 100 Days Of ML Code - Month 2 (November 2 - Present)
 #100DaysofMLCode Challenge: to commit an hour a day (or almost everyday) to code/study machine learning for 100 days.

### Day 11: November 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Updated Codelab Project

**Time**: 1 hour

**Thoughts:** Completed and uploaded first Google Codelab assignment.


### Day 12: November 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CourseraML: Week 2 Videos - Octave/MATLAB Tutorials

**Time**: 1 hour

**Thoughts:** Watched videos on how to use MATLAB and how to submit assignments for class.

### Day 13: November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Intro to Spell

**Time**: 2 hours

**Thoughts:** Learned how to use Spell for machine learning in the Cloud. I started by watching this Coding Train [video](https://youtu.be/ggBOAPtFjYU)


### Day 14: November 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Machine Learning in the Browser

**Time**: 1 hour  

**Thoughts:** Watched a few videos on how to use TensorFlow.js with Coding Train. I also completed a lot of Linear Algebra homework which is kinda related??

### Day 15: November 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CourseraML: Week 3

**Time**: 2.5 hours

**Thoughts:** Went through Logistic Regression videos with my study group. I learned that logistic regression is a linear regression model for classification problems. Understanding how and when to use the sigmoid function was a little confusion, but made a lot of sense after discussing the homework with the group.

<!-- ### Day 16: November 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CourseraML: HW #2 - Linear Regression

**Time**: 1 hour

**Thoughts:** Yesterday, I had my first meeting for my club so I did not have time to complete the challenge. However, today I have my third study group with my CourseraML class. -->

<!-- Completing the first MATLAB assignment in my Coursera class. I will probably use Jupyter Notebooks for uploading my assignments to GitHub as it is easier to use and better for graphing. -->
